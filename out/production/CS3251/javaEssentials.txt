		1) Java is not a drink.
		2) System.out.println("I like Java")
			System.out.println("You like tea.")

		public class hello {
				public static void main(String[] args) {

				}
		}

		4) a compiler is a program that translates high level language code to low level code which are called 
			machine code so that the computer may understand.

		7) you call it the interperter

		12) int feet = 0 
			int inches = 0
		13) int count = 0;
			double distance = 1.5;
		14) distance = time * 80;
		15) double interest = balance * rate;
		16) b, c, c
		17) int a = 3*x; , b = (x+ y) / 7; , c = (3*x + y)/ (z + 2)
		18)  0
		19) quotient = 2, remainder = 1;
		20) result is 5
		21) a. 52.0
			b. what is happening is that 9 / 5 gives the value of 1 because there are two integers. 
				the programer wanted the value of 9/5 to be a decimal of 1.8.
			c. fahrenheit = (9 / 5.0) * celsius + 32.0;
